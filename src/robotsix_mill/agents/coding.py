"""Implement seam.

``run_implement_agent`` is the single seam the implement *stage* drives
(tests monkeypatch it). It runs ONE coordinator pass (see
:mod:`.coordinating`): a capable model that explores via cheap
sub-agents and edits the repo itself. The deterministic
test→retry→escalate loop lives in the implement *stage*, which
re-invokes this seam with a distilled ``feedback`` diagnosis after a
failed test gate.

Budget/agent failures raise :class:`AgentBudgetError` /
:class:`AgentRunError` so the stage blocks-as-resumable (a resume just
re-runs the coordinator fresh — it re-explores, no transcript needed).

    (for resume); ``new_messages`` is only what this run added (for
    pause detection).

    ``feedback`` — set by the implement stage when it re-invokes after a
    failed test gate — is a distilled diagnosis of that failure,
    forwarded to the coordinator so the next pass fixes exactly it.
    ``reference_files`` — pre-loaded file content from the refine stage
    (``reference_files.json``), injected as synthetic read_file messages
    on the first coordinator pass so the model starts with those files
    already "read."
    ``message_history`` — advanced/test use: pre-built pydantic-ai
    message history passed through to the coordinator unchanged.
    ``previous_attempt_summary`` — the coordinator's summary from a
    prior pass, injected as a ``<previous_attempt>`` block on retries
    so the model doesn't undo its prior correct work.
    ``file_map`` — kept on the signature for backward compatibility
    with the stage runner (which loads it from ``file_map.json`` for
    *scope enforcement*); not used for routing. The implement agent
    is always the primary worker and can delegate to per-domain
    expert sub-agents via its ``consult_expert`` tool, with each
    expert keeping its own memory ledger."""
